Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n![/Users/wanyizhu/Desktop/Dissertation file/bee-flying-away.jpg](/Users/wanyizhu/Desktop/Dissertation file/bee-flying-away.jpg)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Matlab codes for honey bee stage model\r\n\"Healthy Colony dynamics\" folder includes all the matlab codes for simulating a healthy colony dynamics-first run the trialsurf to simulate a range of honey collection accumulated by the active nectar foragers bythe end of each day, parameters values are in the \"honeycollection.m\", the ode equations are in the \"nectarODE.m\"\r\n \r\n### Matlab codes for sensitivity tests \r\n\"sensitivitytestsfolder\" includes all the codes to run the two sensitivity tests (First-global Morris Screening--ttmorris, second-EFAST-ttfast) to evaluate the importance of each parameters, the \"comparisionwithactualcolonyweightdata FPE2012.m\" is the code to compare the model simulation with the 2012 field data of colony weight\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
