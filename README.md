Honey bee population dynamics model project
==============

matlab codes for honey bee stage model and sensitivity tests 

"Healthy Colony dynamics" folder includes all the matlab codes for simulating a healthy colony dynamics-first run the trialsurf to simulate a range of honey collection accumulated by the active nectar foragers by the end of each day, parameters values are in the "honeycollection.m", the ode equations are in the "nectarODE.m",
bees.m(bees.txt) includes the dynamics of bees and food(honey and pollen)during the field season, WintersR.m includes the dynamics of bees at the winter time, TestNop.m includes the values of stage-specific survival and food consumption rate, as well as the codes to run the numerical simulation for three years dynamics.  

"Sensitivitytest" folder includes all the codes to run the two sensitivity tests (First-global Morris Screening--ttmorris, second-EFAST-ttfast) to evaluate the importance of each parameters, the "comparisionwithactualcolonyweightdata FPE2012.m" is the code to compare the model simulation with the 2012 field data of colony weight
